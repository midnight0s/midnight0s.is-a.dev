  <h1>Welcome to midnight0s.is-a.dev (hi maintainers!!)</h1>
  <p>This website is a work in progress, but to get a gist of it here's some stuff that'll make its way here</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>personal projects
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/fyrebolt/lahacks">SignSync</a>, a project developed for <a href="https://www.losaltoshacks.com/">Los Altos Hacks VIII</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/midnight0s/phv-bitconnect">BitConnect</a>, a project developed for <a href="https://pioneerhacks.org/">PionnerHacks V</a></li>
        <li>Other small projects, which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/midnight0s">my GitHub</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>stuff i'm working on
      <ul>

  <br>
  <p>In addition to the above, this website will also be remade using Ruby on Rails as I learn more of it eventually.</p>
  <p>I understand if what I currently have is not enough to be passed for registration, but I hope that you consider the above summary of this website's future contents as passable. Regardless, thank you for your time!</p>
